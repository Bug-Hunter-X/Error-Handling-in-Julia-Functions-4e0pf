# Julia Error Handling Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: how to correctly handle errors thrown by the `error()` function.  The `bug.jl` file contains code that throws an error when a negative number is passed to the function, and `bugSolution.jl` provides a solution that uses a `try-catch` block for robust error handling.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `bug.jl` to see the error.
4. Run `bugSolution.jl` to see the improved error handling.
